                <h2>Hi, I'm Sandu Subedi</h2>
                <p>I'm an economic scholar exploring how trade policies, financial access, health policies, and labor markets
                    shape lives in
                    Nepal and beyond. My work combines rigorous econometric and computational methods with real-world policy data to uncover patterns in trade, financial inclusion, labor markets, and public health that shape economic opportunity in Nepal and comparable developing economies.</p>
                <p> I received my Bachelor's degree in Business Studies and Master's in Economics from Central Department of Economics, Tribhuvan
                    University. Currently, I work as Economics Instructor at
                    Bridgewater Education Foundation and Research Center.</p>

            <h3>Beyond Research</h3>
            <p>When I'm away from data, models and policies, I enjoy hiking trails around Kathmandu Valley and walking with my
                pet Fugi (pug) in the park.</p>
